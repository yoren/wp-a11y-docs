Please note: this website is a work in progress and is still in the setup phase. This knowledge base has no content yet and the site needs an accessibility audit. Please visit, for now, the documentation on the [Make WordPress Accessible Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/handbook/).

This website aims to provide you with answers about WordPress and accessibility. How do you design and create an accessible website or plugin? How do you write accessible content? What do you need to know to comply with international legislation? 

We'll provide documentation, effective examples (both what to do and what to avoid) and reliable, up-to-date resources.

Additionally, we are developing a pattern library with code examples. We aim to meet [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/).

Did we miss a topic? Did you find an error or have a great idea? Create an issue on our [GitHub repository yoren/wp-a11y-docs](https://github.com/yoren/wp-a11y-docs/issues/).

We would like to [invite you to contribute](/docs/contribute/) to this Knowledge Base.

Let's make the web for everyone.
